/**
 * Record the shape and compressed size of a built `dist/`, so a later build
 * can be diffed against it (spec-03 NFR-305 / VC-326; spec-05 NFR-505 / VC-513).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   git worktree add ... <baseline commit>
 *   npm run build
 *   node scripts/record-baseline-build.mjs dist tests/e2e/baseline-build.json 8df7fa5
 *   # color-mode budget (NFR-505):
 *   node scripts/record-baseline-build.mjs dist tests/e2e/baseline-build-theme.json 0a4194f
 *
 * `scripts/record-baselines.mjs` drives this from a commit rather than from a
 * built `dist/`, and is what CI and CONTRIBUTING.md use; call this one
 * directly only when the build is already in front of you.
 *
 * `gzipSync` is only as reproducible as the zlib Node was linked against, and
 * the flavours disagree: Node 26 ships stock zlib on darwin and zlib-ng on
 * linux, which differ by ~152 KB over the vendored blobs and ~1.1 KB over the
 * app files, and even the two linux arches differ by 2 B. `perf.spec.ts`
 * therefore diffs the app files only, against the entry of `gzippedAppBy` that
 * names the compressor doing the comparing — so a record grows an entry per
 * environment it is recorded on, and covers none it has not seen.
