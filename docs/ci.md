# Continuous integration, PR artifacts and releases

Spec: [`specs/02-ci.md`](../specs/02-ci.md).

Two GitHub Actions workflows carry everything:

| File | Trigger | Token | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`.github/workflows/pr.yml`](../.github/workflows/pr.yml) | `pull_request` into `main` | `contents: read` | Runs the suite as a merge gate and publishes the built site as a per-PR artifact |
| [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) | `push` to `main` | `contents: write` | Re-runs the gate, derives a semver bump from the commit subject, tags it, and cuts a GitHub Release with the built site attached |

Neither deploys anything. Netlify continues to build and deploy from its own
git integration — see [`deployment.md`](deployment.md#continuous-integration-does-not-deploy).

---

## 1. The PR pipeline

### Trigger

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, edited]
```

`edited` matters. The `pr-title` check gates on the pull request *title*, which
can change with no push at all. Without `edited`, a pull request opened with a
malformed title would keep a red required check that no contributor action could
refresh — you would have to push an empty commit to clear a typo.

Runs are grouped per pull request and superseded runs are **cancelled**
(`concurrency: pr-<number>`, `cancel-in-progress: true`), so only the newest run
reports a merge-gating status.

### The seven required checks

Every job below is a required check for merging into `main`. The names are the
contract — branch protection references them by string, so renaming a job breaks
the gate until the setting is updated.

| Check | Command | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `pr-title` | an inline validator over `github.event.pull_request.title` | FR-111 |
| `typecheck` | `npx tsc --noEmit` | FR-102 |
| `unit` | `npm run test:unit` | FR-103 |
| `e2e-chromium` | `npx playwright test --project=chromium` | FR-104 |
| `audit-contrast` | `npm run audit:contrast` | FR-105 |
| `audit-perf` | `npm run audit:perf` | FR-106 |
| `artifact` | `npm run build`, then `tar -czf … -C dist .` | FR-107 |

`typecheck` runs `npx tsc --noEmit` directly rather than through an npm script:
`package.json` has no `typecheck` script, and spec-02 changes no existing file
except the `version` field. The required check name is the *job* name.

`artifact` declares `needs: [typecheck, unit, e2e-chromium, audit-contrast,
audit-perf]` and no `if:`, so a red gate leaves it **skipped** rather than
failed, and the run's conclusion is the gate's own.

### PR titles are Conventional Commits

Because pull requests are squash-merged with the commit message defaulted to the
pull request title, the title *becomes* the commit subject the release pipeline
derives the version from. So it is validated on the way in:

```
<type>[(<scope>)][!]: <subject>
```

Accepted types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `revert`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`,
`refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-titles) for the bump each
one produces.

The title is passed to the validator through `env:`, never interpolated into a
`run:` body — a title is attacker-controlled text on a fork pull request.

### The one skipped test

A passing `e2e-chromium` log reads **`85 passed, 1 skipped`**. The single skip is
`tests/e2e/stop.spec.ts` → *VC-059 (BR-008): a 6-minute untouched run is still
running*, which skips unless `RUN_LONG=1`.

This is a deliberate, recorded deviation from VC-105's literal "zero tests
report `skipped`", because three of the spec's own requirements cannot all hold
at once:

- VC-105 / BR-105 want zero skips;
- *Scope → Out* and VC-139 put VC-059 out of CI scope and forbid either workflow
  from setting `RUN_LONG`;
- FR-104 requires the CI set to be "the same set a local `npx playwright test`
  runs", which rules out narrowing the command with `--grep-invert`.

Keeping the command unnarrowed is the reading that preserves FR-104 and VC-139,
so the skip stays and is documented here instead. It is the only skip permitted:
**any second skipped test is a regression**, not a new exception. Run the real
six-minute check locally with `RUN_LONG=1 npx playwright test --grep "VC-059"`.

### Failure diagnostics

When `e2e-chromium`, `audit-contrast` or `audit-perf` fails, that job uploads
`playwright-report/` and `test-results/` (traces included) as
`playwright-report-pr.<number>`, retained **7 days**. The upload is guarded by
`if: failure()`, so a fully green run publishes no diagnostics artifact at all.

All three jobs use the same artifact name with `overwrite: true`, so a run in
which two browser jobs fail still leaves exactly one diagnostics artifact rather
than a name collision.

Traces exist because `playwright.config.ts` sets `trace: 'on-first-retry'` and
`retries: 2` under `CI`; a failing test therefore always retries at least once
and always leaves a `trace.zip`.

### Retries, and the one test known to flake

`retries: 2` under `CI` is the **only** retry mechanism in either pipeline. No
gate step is wrapped in a retry loop and `continue-on-error` appears nowhere, so
a red check is a real verdict.

One test is timing-sensitive enough to flake on a loaded machine: *VC-054
(NFR-009): continuous output never blocks the main thread, and Stop still lands
in 500 ms*. It was observed failing once and passing on the first retry during
local verification — reported as `1 flaky`, with the run still green. That is
precisely what the sanctioned retry is for, and a flake costs a retry, not a
verdict.

Worth knowing because `audit-perf` and NFR-009 measure a 500 ms budget on
hardware the thresholds were not set on: if `e2e-chromium` starts reporting
`flaky` on a *different* test, or VC-054 begins failing all three attempts, that
is a signal about the runner, not noise to retry harder. The response is BR-104's
— a faster runner or a real fix, never a relaxed budget.

### The PR artifact

| Thing | Grammar | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Artifact and the tarball inside it | `pyplay-<base-version>-pr.<pr-number>+<short-sha>` | `pyplay-0.1.0-pr.42+a1b2c3d` |

- `base-version` — `package.json`'s `version` at the head commit;
- `pr-number` — decimal, unpadded;
- `short-sha` — the first 7 characters of the **head** commit SHA.

The name is a semver-legal prerelease + build-metadata string, so it sorts below
the release it precedes.

The short SHA comes from `github.event.pull_request.head.sha`, not `github.sha`.
On a `pull_request` event `github.sha` is the ephemeral merge commit, which
appears nowhere in the pull request's UI; the head SHA is the one a reviewer can
match against the commit list. (The spec's *Pipeline inputs* table names
`github.sha`, while VC-118 asks for the head — this resolves that in favour of
the head.)

The tarball is packed with `tar -czf … -C dist .`, so it extracts to the
**contents** of `dist/` with no wrapping directory:

```
index.html   sw.js   precache-manifest.json   _headers   assets/   pyodide/   ruff/
```

Retention is **14 days**, and the upload sets `if-no-files-found: error` so a
build that produced nothing fails loudly instead of uploading silence.

#### Downloading a PR build

Open the pull request → **Checks** → the `artifact` job → **Artifacts**, or:

```bash
gh run download --name "pyplay-<version>-pr.<number>+<sha>" --dir /tmp/build
tar -xzf /tmp/build/pyplay-*.tar.gz -C /tmp/site
```

Serve `/tmp/site` with **both** isolation headers or blocking `input()` will not
work — `SharedArrayBuffer` is only exposed to a cross-origin isolated document:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

`npm run preview` sends them for a local `dist/`; for an extracted tarball use
any static server that can add the two headers.

#### One artifact per pull request

After uploading, the `artifact` job deletes the superseded commit's
`pyplay-*-pr.<N>+*` artifact through the artifacts REST API, so exactly one
exists per open pull request.

It attempts this with the run's own **read-only** token. If that token cannot
delete, the step says so and leaves the artifact to expire rather than failing —
and the permission is *not* widened to make it work, because BR-106 forbids a
pull request run holding any write scope. In that case FR-108's "exactly one"
rests on the 14-day retention alone. This is the one place the pipeline
deliberately prefers a weaker guarantee over a stronger token.

---

## 2. The release pipeline

Triggered by any push to `main` — a squash-merge or a direct push.

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: release-main
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

Release runs **queue**; they are never cancelled. A cancelled release can leave a
tag without a Release, or a Release without its asset. A superseded PR run, whose
only product is a status, is safe to cancel; a release run is not.

### Job by job

The five gate jobs — `typecheck`, `unit`, `e2e-chromium`, `audit-contrast`,
`audit-perf` — are the same commands as `pr.yml`, run against the pushed commit.
Nothing publishes unless all five are green.

They are **duplicated** rather than extracted into a reusable `workflow_call`
workflow. A reusable workflow is the DRY choice, but the spec's added-files table
lists exactly two workflow files and VC-114, VC-115, VC-137, VC-138 and VC-139
each inspect "both workflow files" — gate steps in a third file would fall
outside everything those criteria grep. The ~40 lines of duplication buy literal
verifiability. If a future change prefers a reusable workflow, restate those five
criteria over three files first.

Then `publish` (`needs:` all five):

1. **Checkout** with `fetch-depth: 0` and `fetch-tags: true`, so the tag scan
   sees history rather than a shallow clone.
2. **Derive** the version by piping `git log -1 --format=%B` into
   [`scripts/derive-version.mjs`](../scripts/derive-version.mjs), with the tags
   reachable from *this run's own* commit. On *none*, log and exit 0 having
   created nothing.
3. **Idempotency check** — if the derived tag already exists locally or on the
   remote, log "version already released" and exit 0, changing no tag, Release or
   asset.
4. **Version commit** — `npm version --no-git-tag-version` plus
   `npm install --package-lock-only`, committing **only** `package.json` and
   `package-lock.json` with the subject `chore(release): vX.Y.Z [skip ci]`.
5. **Annotated tag** `vX.Y.Z` on that commit, pushed after it.
6. **Build and pack** `pyplay-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` from this run's own checkout.
7. **Release** — non-draft, non-prerelease, named `vX.Y.Z`, with GitHub's
   generated notes and exactly that one asset.

The order is deliberate: the version commit lands, then the tag, then the
Release. A run interrupted between two steps leaves a recoverable state, and a
re-run hits the idempotency check in step 3 instead of duplicating anything.

### Version derivation

The bump comes from the commit **subject** alone, and the base version comes from
the highest `vX.Y.Z` **tag** — never from `package.json`, which is a mirror the
pipeline maintains, not an input.

| Commit | Bump |
|---|---|
| `feat:` / `feat(scope):` | minor |
| `fix:` / `perf:` / `revert:` | patch |
| any type with `!` before the colon, or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | **major** |
| `chore:` `docs:` `style:` `refactor:` `test:` `build:` `ci:` | none — no release |

A breaking marker bumps major **even below 1.0**: `0.1.0` + `feat!:` → `1.0.0`.
The alternative (breaking → minor while below 1.0) means the version silently
stops carrying breakage information for the whole pre-1.0 period, which is
exactly when the persisted-state and worker-protocol contracts are most likely
to break.

Tag comparison is **numeric per component**, so `v0.10.0` outranks `v0.9.0`; a
lexical sort gets that backwards. With no `vX.Y.Z` tag at all the base is
`0.1.0`. Tags that are not a plain `vX.Y.Z` are ignored.

An unrecognized subject produces *none*, not an error — a direct push to `main`
bypasses the `pr-title` check, and the pipeline must not fail on it.

Every row of that table, the pre-1.0 major, the no-tag bootstrap, the numeric
ordering and the unrecognized-subject case are unit-tested in
[`tests/unit/derive-version.test.ts`](../tests/unit/derive-version.test.ts), so
they are verifiable without performing six real squash-merges.

### Nothing retriggers the pipeline

Two independent guarantees against an infinite release loop:

1. the version commit is pushed with the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and a push
   made with that token starts no workflow run;
2. its subject carries `[skip ci]`, and every job in `release.yml` is guarded by
   `if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]')"`, so a future
   trigger change cannot start one either.

### Stale-base recovery

If the version-commit push is rejected because `main` advanced after the
checkout, the run retries **at most 3 times**. Each retry re-fetches `main`,
re-reads the base version from the tags, and re-derives the version from **its
own** triggering commit — never from the commit that overtook it. After a third
rejection the run fails, having created no tag and no Release.

Pushing the version commit to `main` requires that the release workflow's actor
is allowed to push there — see *Repository settings* below. If it is not, this is
exactly what you see: three rejected attempts and a failed run. That is the
intended, loud failure mode, not a silent release without its version mirror.

---

## 3. Caches

| Cache | Key | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| npm | `package-lock.json` hash | `actions/setup-node` with `cache: npm` |
| Playwright browsers | `playwright-<os>-chromium-<resolved @playwright/test version>` | `actions/cache` over `~/.cache/ms-playwright` |

Both are required, not optional. On a browser-cache hit the job runs
`npx playwright install-deps chromium` (system packages only); on a miss it runs
`npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`. Only **chromium** is ever
installed — the pinned browser matrix stays a local command.

The Playwright key is the resolved package version rather than the lockfile hash,
so an unrelated dependency bump does not evict the browser download.

---

## 4. Thresholds are never relaxed for CI

Every numeric threshold the audits and the e2e suite assert is the value spec-01
fixed. A gate that fails because the runner is slower than the reference profile
is fixed by a faster runner, a larger runner label, or a genuine performance fix
— **never** by editing a threshold, adding a CI-only tolerance, or skipping the
assertion. A threshold that moves to match the hardware measures the hardware
instead of the product.

Nothing in the repository switches a threshold on `CI`. The only `CI`-conditional
settings are Playwright's `forbidOnly`, `retries: 2` and `reuseExistingServer`,
none of which is a threshold or an assertion:

```bash
grep -rn "process.env.CI" src tests playwright.config.ts
```

`audit-perf` is the check most likely to fail on hardware rather than on a
regression: it boots a 13 MB Pyodide WASM runtime, which is CPU-bound, and its
thresholds were measured on a maintainer's laptop against loopback. It is a
required check anyway, because a performance gate that does not gate is not a
gate. That is why every measurement is printed next to its threshold — the log
shows how much headroom the runner actually has.

---

## 5. Fork pull requests

A pull request from a fork runs every gate and uploads the FR-107 artifact, with
a token that has **no write scope and no repository secrets**.

- `pr.yml` declares exactly `permissions: contents: read` — explicitly, never the
  runner's default set.
- It references no `secrets.*` other than the GitHub-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- It is triggered by the `pull_request` event only.

That last point deserves its own note. GitHub has a sibling trigger,
`pull_request_target`, which runs the *base* repository's workflow with a
**writable** token while checking out the *fork's* code. It grants precisely what
this repository forbids, and it is easy to reach for later when a pull request
job appears to "need" a token. **It must never be used in this repository.**

BR-106 names it explicitly for that reason, and VC-114 checks that neither
workflow is triggered by it. The workflow files themselves therefore do not
mention it even in a comment — the spec's scope check greps those two files for
the literal token, so the rule is recorded here instead, which is why
`pr.yml`'s header comment points at this section rather than naming it.

PR code is untrusted by construction: a fork pull request can run arbitrary build
and test code. Nothing a PR run can reach may be able to tag, release, or
authenticate anywhere. Only `release.yml`, which runs on `push` to `main` after
the merge, holds `contents: write`.

Every third-party `uses:` is pinned to a full 40-character commit SHA with the
human-readable version in a trailing comment. A moving tag such as `@v4` is a
mutable dependency with write access to the release pipeline:

```bash
grep -nE 'uses:' .github/workflows/*.yml   # every ref must be a 40-char SHA
```

---

## 6. Repository settings

These live in GitHub's settings, not in this repository, and a maintainer must
configure them. The workflows are correct without them but the guarantees are
not complete.

1. **Squash merge only**, with the commit message defaulted to the **pull
   request title**. Merge commits and rebase merges disabled. Without this,
   FR-111's validated title is not what the release pipeline reads, and the bump
   is derived from an unvalidated subject.
2. **Branch protection on `main`** requiring these seven checks:
   `pr-title`, `typecheck`, `unit`, `e2e-chromium`, `audit-contrast`,
   `audit-perf`, `artifact`.
3. **The release workflow's actor may push to `main`** — branch protection either
   exempts it or lets the release pipeline bypass the required checks it has just
   run on that very commit. This is a hard prerequisite: without it the release
   pipeline fails at its third rejected push, by design, rather than releasing
   without its version mirror.

---

## 7. Measured figures

The budgets:

| Requirement | Budget |
|---|---|
| NFR-100 PR gate wall clock, warm cache | ≤ 20 min |
| NFR-101 `npm ci` + chromium install, both caches hit | ≤ 150 s |
| NFR-102 push to `main` → published Release | ≤ 25 min |
| NFR-104 tarball, compressed | ≤ 30 MB |
| every job's `timeout-minutes` | ≤ 30 |

Every job in both workflow files declares `timeout-minutes: 30`, so a hung run
fails rather than occupying a runner.

### Local reference profile

Measured on the maintainer's machine (Apple Silicon, Node v26.8.1, warm npm
cache) — the profile spec-01's thresholds were set against:

| Step | Local |
|---|---|
| `npm ci` (cold `node_modules`, warm npm cache) | 0.9 s |
| `npm run build` | 4 s |
| `npx playwright test --project=chromium` | 1.2 min (85 passed, 1 skipped) |
| `npm run audit:contrast` | 6.5 s |
| `npm run audit:perf` | 8.0 s |
| `npm run test:matrix` (local only) | 51 s (6 passed, 2 skipped: no Edge engine) |
| tarball, compressed | 8.86 MB |

The tarball figure is the one that transfers directly: it is produced by the same
`tar -czf … -C dist .` the workflows run, and at 8.86 MB it sits well inside
NFR-104's 30 MB.

### `audit-perf` headroom on the reference profile

```
NFR-001 shell interactive       85 ms   (<= 2000)     96% headroom
NFR-002 cold runtime ready    1041 ms   (<= 10000)    90% headroom
NFR-003 warm runtime ready     930 ms   (<= 2500)     63% headroom
NFR-004 compressed transfer   8.83 MiB  (<= 15.00)    41% headroom
NFR-005 Run to first output     35 ms   (<= 250)      86% headroom
NFR-007 lint 500 lines          21 ms   (<= 300)      93% headroom
NFR-008 format 500 lines        20 ms   (<= 300)      93% headroom
```

NFR-003 (warm runtime ready, 63%) and NFR-004 (transfer size, 41%) are the
tightest. NFR-004 is hardware-independent — it is a byte count — so the binding
CPU-bound constraint on a slower runner is **NFR-003 at 2.5 s**, with NFR-002 the
next in line.

### Runner figures: not yet measured

> The GitHub-hosted figures for NFR-100, NFR-101 and NFR-102 are **pending the
> first real runs** and must be filled in here once observed. Nothing in this
> repository can measure them; they require a pull request and a push to `main`
> on GitHub. Until then, treat the wall-clock and install budgets as unverified.

To record them:

1. Open a pull request and let it run twice, so the second run has warm npm and
   Playwright caches. Take the run's total wall clock, and the summed duration of
   the `npm ci` and chromium-install steps in one browser job.
2. Note the `audit-perf` measurements from that run's log and compare them with
   the reference profile above — that difference *is* the runner headroom.
3. Merge a `feat:` pull request and time the push to `main` against the Release's
   publication timestamp.

Note that each of `e2e-chromium`, `audit-contrast`, `audit-perf` and `artifact`
runs a full vendor + build, because `playwright.config.ts` declares
`webServer[0].command = 'npm run build && npx vite preview …'` and each job is a
separate runner. Those jobs run in parallel, so this costs runner minutes rather
than wall clock, but it is a real input to NFR-100. If the shape misses the
20-minute budget, the permitted responses are a larger runner label or a genuine
fix — not a threshold edit.
